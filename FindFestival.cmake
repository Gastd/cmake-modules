#		Find Festival on the development system.
# This module finds if Festival is installed and determines where the
# include files and libraries are. It also determines what the name of
# the library is. This code sets the following variables:
#
#	FESTIVAL_INCLUDE_DIR 	- path where festival.h is found
#	FESTIVAL_LIBRARIES		- path to the Festival library
